## Version History

- 1.0-draft1 (June 2025) Initial draft.
- 1.0-draft2 (August 2025)
  1. Separated into guidance for CP1 (this document), and a "Next" document that contains the preparations for further extensions beyond CP1.
  2. Removed content not directly relevant for CP1:
     1. External URL links for download of alternative formats (IWXXM will be passed in the message payload)
     2. Content type "application/url-list"
     3. geometry properties (aerodrome coordinates, SIGMET bounding boxes)
     4. payload integrity properties based on WIS 2.0 WNM, SWIM TI Yellow Profile 2.0 mandates usage of S/MIME 4.0 for this purpose.
     5. Technical messages
  3. The only way of sending IWWXM is now embeddeding the data in the AMQP message payload with content type `application/xml`. All mentions of `links` and `url-list` have been removed.
  4. Discarded `subject` strings of type `DATA_METAR_LOWS_CORRECTION_2025040106450` because they create duplicity to the AMQP application properties, which are a much better filtering mechanism compared to application of wildcard patterns to a subject string (suggestion by Dario di Crescenzo).
  5. The "subject" string now contains simply `aviation.weather.metar`.
  6. Dropped all `properties.` prefixes, e.g. `properties.start_datetime`. The `properties` object is used in WIS 2.0 Notification Message (WNM) standard because the WNM notifications conform to GeoJSON structure. The GeoJSON specification mandates that all custom properties need to be placed in a separate `properties` sub-object. In AMQP, however, the application properties concept is the direct equivalent of the GeoJSON properties - it is a list of application-defined data. So there is no strict need for usage of the prefix.
  7. New application property `report_type` with values _NORMAL_, _AMENDMENT_, _CORRECTION_.
  8. New application property `issue_time` replaces previous `properties.pubtime`. The publication time in WIS 2.0 WNM is the creation time of the notification message, so using this terminology for METAR, TAF, or SIGMET issue time was incorrect. In AMQP the direct equivalent of properties.pubtime is the AMQP transport header property `creation-time`.
  9. Added AMQP transport header property `creation-time`.
  10. Rewritten section on `absolute-expiry-time`. The original idea of specifying expiration of 3h for METAR, 12h for TAF, 24h for SIGMET was incorrect.
  11. The guidance for the priority field in AMQP transport header just states that certain message types should have higher priorities than others. For example, a TAF AMD should have higher priority than a regular TAF.
  12. Added mention of _AMQP Messaging with Message Security_ using S/MIME 4.0 as defined in SWIM TI Yellow Profile 2.0, but without further implementation guidance. This section needs to be fleshed out.

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 1.0-draft | 2025-06 | Initial draft. |
| 1.0-draft2 | 2025-08 | Incorporated feedback, simplified, split into "CP1" and "Next" for properties beyond CP1. |

## Introduction

This document defines the message structure and properties for AMQP 1.0 messages used in the MET-SWIM (Meteorological System Wide Information Management) implementation of the European Union Common Project Regulation (CP1). It provides guidance for developers and organisations implementing meteorological OPMET data distribution using AMQP 1.0 protocol in line with the SWIM Service definitions.

The guidance is maintained by the EUROCONTROL MET3SG Task Team on Service Architecture.

### Objectives

- Ensure interoperability between different MET-SWIM implementations
- Standardise AMQP message properties for meteorological data exchange
- Enable efficient filtering of messages
- Enable routing of messages to downstream systems based on typical information like report type or aerodrome/FIR code.
- Provide forward compatibility for future meteorological data types beyond CP1

### Scope (for CP1)

This specification currently covers the following meteorological report types that are covered by CP1 SWIM Service Definitions in IWXXM format:

- METAR
- SPECI
- TAF
- SIGMET

### WMO WIS 2.0 Notification Messages Relationship

This specification takes inspiration from the [WMO WIS 2.0 Notification Message Standard](https://wmo-im.github.io/wis2-notification-message/standard/wis2-notification-message-STABLE.html) while being tailored to the AMQP property syntax and specific requirements of MET-SWIM and the aviation meteorological community.

The WNM notification specification also guided the design of the notification messages in [OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval (EDR) Part 2: Publish-Subscribe workflow](https://docs.ogc.org/is/23-057r1/23-057r1.html), which is used, for example, by the UK Met Office's QVA API (Quantitative Volcanic Ash) and is planned to be used by the SADIS API.

## AMQP 1.0 Message Structure

An AMQP message in the MET-SWIM context consists of the following components:

1. **Message Addressing** - Destination address using a hierarchical structure
2. **Message Transport Header** - Priority settings, expiration.
3. **Message Properties** - Standard AMQP properties including subject, content-type, etc.
4. **Application Properties** - Custom properties for meteorological data identification and filtering
5. **Message Payload** - The actual data (IWXXM XML).

## Message Addressing

### Address Structure

MET-SWIM uses a simplified three-level hierarchical structure for message addresses, inspired by  the [WIS 2 Topic Hierarchy](https://wmo-im.github.io/wis2-topic-hierarchy/standard/wis2-topic-hierarchy-STABLE.html).

For meteorological data, the address structure is:

```text
weather.aviation.<report-type>
```

Where `<report-type>` is one of:

- `metar` - for METAR and SPECI reports
- `taf` - for TAF reports
- `sigmet` - for SIGMET reports

### Examples

```text
weather.aviation.metar
weather.aviation.taf
weather.aviation.sigmet
```

### Wildcard Addresses in Subscriptions

Consumers can subscribe using wildcards to receive messages from multiple related addresses only if the AMQP broker supports wildcard functionality. **Wildcard support is not part of the AMQP 1.0 specification** - it is implemented as a broker-specific extension. Wildcard support is available in the popular AMQP brokers, but is not generally guaranteed.

**Common Wildcard Characters:**

- `*` - matches exactly one level in the hierarchy
- `#` - matches zero or more levels from that point onwards

**Wildcard Examples:**

```text
weather.aviation.*    # Subscribe to all aviation weather types
weather.#             # Subscribe to all weather data
#.metar               # Subscribe to METAR and SPECI
```

#### Broker Compatibility

Different AMQP 1.0 brokers implement wildcard support with varying levels of compatibility:

##### Apache ActiveMQ Artemis

- Full wildcard support using `*` and `#` characters
- Wildcards work with both queues and topics

##### Apache Qpid Proton

- Supports both `*` and `#` wildcards

##### RabbitMQ (with AMQP 1.0 plugin)

- There is some support for `*` and `#`
- RabbitMQ supports wildcards for routing from topic exchanges to queues. It does not, however, allow for automatic creation of queues from a topic. The users would need to create a queue and its binding themselves.

## AMQP Transport Header

### Priority

The `priority` field (0-9, where 9 is highest) SHALL be set according to the operational importance. For this version of the specification the exact priorities are not defined, however:

- SPECI should have higher priority than METAR
- TAF amendments should have higher priority than TAF
- SIGMET should have the highest priority

Example priorities:

| Report Type | Priority | Rationale |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| SIGMET | 7 | Highest priority for safety-critical information |
| SPECI | 6 | Special reports indicating significant changes |
| TAF AMD | 6 | Significant change to the original forecast |
| TAF | 5 | Forecast information with medium priority |
| METAR | 4 | Routine observations |

## AMQP Message Properties

The subsequent section define the AMQP 1.0 message properties used in MET-SWIM implementations. For detailed technical specifications, refer to the [OASIS AMQP 1.0 Specification, Part 3: Messaging](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html).

- The documentation for the AMQP headers specifically is in [OASIS AMQP 1.0 specification, Part 3: Messaging - Section 3.2.5 - Header](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-header).
- See also [AMQP 1.0 specification, Part 3: Messaging, Section 3.2.6 - Properties](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-properties) for more details.

### subject (MANDATORY)

The `subject` SHALL represent the type of data transmitted, analogously to the WMO WIS 2.0 concept of topics and equal to the _source address_. This is useful for disambiguating data when using wildcard source address subscriptions.

Example:

```text
weather.aviation.metar
```

**Note:** In earlier versions of this specification, it was proposed that the `subject` string should hold the report type (METAR, SPECI, TAF, SIGMET), aerodrome or airspace ICAO code, issue time of the report, and so on. However, this created a duplicate identification and filtering mechanism competing with the application properties. Application properties, along with the SQL-like filter expressions, are much better suited for filtering purposes compared to wildcard patterns applied to subject strings.

### content-type (MANDATORY)

Indicates the MIME type of the payload and SHALL be set to `application/xml` for the IWXXM XML data.

### content-encoding (CONDITIONAL)

By default, payloads are not compressed, and in this case, the `content-encoding` property can be left out. However, when compression is applied to the payload, the `content-encoding` is mandatory.

The MET-SWIM service AMQP implementations and clients SHALL support the following content-encodings from [IANA HTTP Content Coding Registry|https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-parameters/http-parameters.xhtml]:

- `gzip` - for compressed data. This is the most widely supported compressed `content-encoding` in HTTP.
- `identity` - for uncompressed data (default if omitted).

### absolute-expiry-time (OPTIONAL)

Unix timestamp indicating when the message should expire in the broker and from the durable queues.

The `absolute-expiry-time` tells the broker when it should discard a message. On the other hand, the `ttl` field in the AMQP transport header (relative number in milliseconds) is typically calculated using a difference between the `absolute-expiry-time` and the time when the message was created. The `absolute-expiry-time` stays constant during the message's lifetime, whereas `ttl` can be progressively decreased by AMQP intermediaries.

When `absolute expiry time` is not set, the message will "live" in durable queues until a client receives it. Brokers usually have some pre-configured threshold of maximum `ttl` to avoid resource exhaustion if clients do not pick up messages from durable queues.

If a MET-SWIM AMQP implementation sets the absolute-expiry-time, it SHOULD set it high enough to:

- Give the clients a chance to receive the messages during shorter communication outages or client maintenance periods.
- Keep the messages long enough to survive the AMQP server maintenance windows or outages.

Example: AMQP message creation + 12 hours

Note: Originally, it was proposed to set the absolute-expiry-time depending on the report type, e.g. 3h for METAR, 12h for TAF, 24h for SIGMET. However, in general, there can be varying purposes for why the client needs to be subscribed to the data:

- One client might be interested only in the latest operationally useful data.
- Another client might be a climatological database that needs all the reports regardless of age. In this case loosing observations due to a 3h communication outage does not seem reasonable.

### creation-time (OPTIONAL)

This is the Unix timestamp indicating when the AMQP message was initially created. It mostly serves an informational purpose in AMQP and is used in the `ttl` calculation in some brokers.

## AMQP Application Properties

The application properties are the most flexible mechanism for identifying the data sent using AMQP and enabling server-side filtering using [AMQP Filter Expressions 1.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/filtex/v1.0/filtex-v1.0.html). The AMQP specification does not regulate [AMQP application property](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-application-properties) names and meanings. They are custom-defined by individual services that use AMQP as their notification layer. 

Properties in the sections below are divided into categories based on their usage requirements:

- _mandatory_: need to be present at all times,
- _conditional_: are mandatory under stated conditions,
- _optional_: their presence is left to the implementation, but when included, they SHALL adhere to this specification.

**Note:** Earlier revisions of this guidance used a `properties.` prefix to stay close to the _WIS 2.0 Notification Message (WNM)_ standard. However:

1. The usage of the `properties` object in WNM is only due to the WIS 2.0 notification message conforming to the GeoJSON formatting ([RFC 7946](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946)).
2. The GeoJSON specification requires that all custom properties be stored in a `properties` sub-object rather than in the top-level object reserved for feature type declaration and geometry.
3. In AMQP, this is unnecessary because the direct equivalent of the GeoJSON custom properties are the AMQP application properties, so there is no need to use any prefix.
4. See also the [WNM message](https://wmo-im.github.io/wis2-notification-message/standard/wis2-notification-message-STABLE.html#_wis2_notification_message_examples) example from the WIS 2.0 specification.

> **TODO:** is this a good decision, or should we go back to using the `"properties."` prefix to have a more 1:1 correspondence to the WNM JSON?

### Examples of AMQP Filter Expressions applied to Application Properties

```sql
-- Filter by specific airports
icao_location_identifier IN ('EBBR', 'EDDF')

-- Filter by country prefix
icao_location_identifier LIKE 'EB%'

-- Filter by location and type
icao_location_identifier LIKE 'EB%' 
  AND icao_location_type IN ('CTA', 'FIR', 'AD')

-- Filter by topic pattern
subject LIKE 'weather.aviation.%'
```

### Mandatory Application Properties

These properties MUST be present in all meteorological data messages.

#### report_status (mandatory)

One of the following values:

- `NORMAL` - Regular report
- `AMENDMENT` - Amendment of a previous report
- `CORRECTION` - Correction of a previous report

This is directly based on the IWXXM `reportStatus` attribute.

#### icao_location_identifier (mandatory)

ICAO identifier of the location. Mandatory for reports that are issued for an aerodrome or an airspace that a 4-letter ICAO location designator can identify.

```text
icao_location_identifier: "EBBR"
```

#### icao_location_type (mandatory)

Type of location identifier. Mandatory if `icao_location_identifier` was provided.

- `AD` - Aerodrome (for METAR/TAF)
  - From AIXM [AirportHeliportType](https://aixm.aero/sites/default/files/imce/AIXM51HTML/AIXM/DataType_CodeAirportHeliportType.html)
- `FIR` - Flight Information Region (for SIGMET)
  - From AIXM [AirspaceType](https://aixm.aero/sites/default/files/imce/AIXM511HTML/AIXM/DataType_CodeAirspaceType.html)
- `UIR` - Upper Information Region
  - From AIXM [AirspaceType](https://aixm.aero/sites/default/files/imce/AIXM511HTML/AIXM/DataType_CodeAirspaceType.html)
- `CTA` - Control Area
  - From AIXM [AirspaceType](https://aixm.aero/sites/default/files/imce/AIXM511HTML/AIXM/DataType_CodeAirspaceType.html)
- `OTHER:FIR_UIR` - Combined FIR/UIR
  - This is the FIR/UIR encoding used in `aixm:type` in <https://schemas.wmo.int/iwxxm/2025-2RC1/examples/sigmet-A6-1a-TS.xml>

#### conformsTo (conditional)

If there is a service definition the data conforms to (e.g. the CP1 compliant SWIM Service Definitions), this field SHOULD link to the service definition. The field identifies the specification version and the corresponding SWIM service definition.

```text
conformsTo: "https://eur-registry.swim.aero/services/eurocontrol-iwxxm-[service-type]-10"
```

Example values:

- `https://eur-registry.swim.aero/services/eurocontrol-iwxxm-metar-speci-subscription-and-request-service-10`
- `https://eur-registry.swim.aero/services/eurocontrol-iwxxm-taf-subscription-and-request-service-10`
- `https://eur-registry.swim.aero/services/eurocontrol-iwxxm-sigmet-subscription-and-request-service-10`

### Temporal Properties

These properties contain date and time information extracted from the IWXXM document.

#### issue_time (mandatory)

[RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) formatted publication/issue time extracted from `iwxxm:issueTime`:

```yaml
issue_time: "2025-04-15T14:10:00Z"
```

This property is mandatory for all the CP1 message types.

**Note:** In previous proposals, this was called `pubtime` in reference to WIS 2.0 WNP publication time (`properties.pubtime`). However, the meaning of publication time in WNM is when the message was initially sent, which is closer to the meaning of the `creation-time` in the AMQP transport header.

#### datetime (conditional)

For METAR/SPECI only - observation time in [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format from `iwxxm:observationTime`:

```yaml
datetime: "2025-03-31T03:00:00Z"
```

**Note:** Corresponds to `properties.datetime` in WIS 2.0 Notification Messages, see [Properties / Temporal description](https://wmo-im.github.io/wis2-notification-message/standard/wis2-notification-message-STABLE.html#_1_12_properties_temporal_description) in the WNM specification.

#### start_datetime (conditional)

For TAF/SIGMET - start of validity period in [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format from `iwxxm:validPeriod`:

```yaml
start_datetime: "2025-04-15T14:30:00Z"
```

**Note:** `start_datetime` and `end_datetime` properties correspond to the equivalently named properties in the WIS 2.0 Notification Messages. See [Properties / Temporal description](https://wmo-im.github.io/wis2-notification-message/standard/wis2-notification-message-STABLE.html#_1_12_properties_temporal_description) in the WNM specification.

#### end_datetime (conditional)

For TAF/SIGMET - end of validity period in [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format:

```yaml
end_datetime: "2025-04-15T18:00:00Z"
```

### AMQP with Message Security

SWIM TI Yellow Profile 2.0 section 3.1.1.12 defines Service Interface Binding of type "AMQP Messaging with Message Security" that enables detection of data corruption during transmission and ensures data authenticity. This is by leveraging the [S/MIME 4.0 (RFC 8551)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8551) standard used in emails.

**Note:** Our previous proposal was to adopt integrity methods from WIS 2.0 WNM specification, but since Yellow Profile 2.0 endorses S/MIME 4.0 there is no need to copy the integrity mechanisms from WIS 2.0.

> **TODO:** Provide more guidance on using S/MIME 4.0.

## Message Payload

For IWXXM XML documents, the payload SHALL contain the complete IWXXM XML document representing one METAR, SPECI, TAF or SIGMET report. XML documents using 

- The message property `content-type` must be set to `application/xml`.
- The payload can be optionally compressed using gzip; in this case, the `content-encoding` message property SHALL be set to `gzip`.

## Broker and Client Library Compatibility

### AMQP 1.0 Brokers Successfully Used in MET-SWIM Implementations

The following AMQP 1.0 brokers have been successfully used in MET-SWIM implementations:

| Broker | Wildcard Support | Filter Expressions | Notes |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|-------|
| Apache ActiveMQ Artemis | â | â | Full support for SQL-like filtering |
| RabbitMQ | partial | â | Requires AMQP 1.0 plugin enabled |
| Apache Qpid Broker-J | â | â | Apache's AMQP 1.0 broker implementation |

### AMQP 1.0 Client Libraries Known to Work in MET-SWIM Context

The following client libraries have been successfully used with AMQP 1.0 brokers in real implementations:

**Note:** This section needs to be expanded based on the experience of a wider range of organisations. Qpid Proton C++ and Python APIs are known to work correctly.

#### JavaScript/Node.js

- **Rhea** - A fully compliant AMQP 1.0 library that is actively maintained. This is the JavaScript library for AMQP 1.0 connections that has been confirmed to work. Available at [https://github.com/amqp/rhea](https://github.com/amqp/rhea).

#### Python

- **Qpid Proton Python API** - Part of [Apache Qpid Proton](https://qpid.apache.org/proton/index.html), this is a mature and well-tested library with full AMQP 1.0 support. Successfully used with ActiveMQ Artemis, RabbitMQ, and other AMQP 1.0 brokers.

#### C++

- **Qpid Proton C++** - Part of [Apache Qpid Proton](https://qpid.apache.org/proton/index.html), verified to work properly with AMQP 1.0 brokers. Provides a portable C implementation with C++ bindings.

#### Java

- **Apache Qpid Proton-J** is a Java implementation from [apache Qpid Proton] (https://qpid.apache.org/proton/index.html). While not directly tested in MET-SWIM implementations, it is expected to work reliably based on the proven track record of other Qpid Proton language implementations.

#### DotNet

- **Qpid Proton DotNet** - .NET implementation from [Apache Qpid Proton](https://qpid.apache.org/proton/index.html), part of the same proven toolkit.

**Note**: At the time of writing, evidence of successful AMQP 1.0 implementations in other programming languages (such as Go, Ruby, PHP, or Rust) is limited. Organisations implementing MET-SWIM in these languages should verify compatibility with their chosen broker before deployment.

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Property Extraction from IWXXM

This appendix provides comprehensive guidance for extracting AMQP application properties from IWXXM XML documents. IWXXM (ICAO Meteorological Information Exchange Model) documents follow a structured format defined by XML schemas that include multiple namespaces.

#### Required XML Namespaces

When processing IWXXM documents, XML namespaces must be properly detected and handled. **IWXXM versions and their namespace URIs change over time**, so implementations should use **version-agnostic namespace detection** rather than hardcoded URIs.

**Current IWXXM Schema Location**: [https://schemas.wmo.int/iwxxm/2023-1/](https://schemas.wmo.int/iwxxm/2023-1/)

**Dynamic Namespace Detection**:

Instead of hardcoding specific version URIs, detect namespaces dynamically by their common prefixes:

| Namespace Family | Common Prefix Pattern | Purpose |
|------------------|----------------------|---------|
| IWXXM | `http://icao.int/iwxxm/` or `https://schemas.wmo.int/iwxxm/` | IWXXM meteorological reports |
| AIXM | `http://www.aixm.aero/schema/` | Aeronautical information (airports, airspace) |
| GML | `http://www.opengis.net/gml/` | Geographic markup language |

**Implementation Approach for Namespace Detection**:

1. **Parse the XML document** and access the root element
2. **Extract all namespace declarations** from the document (typically available through the XML parser's namespace map or similar functionality)
3. **Iterate through namespace URIs** and match them against the common prefix patterns shown in the table above
4. **Build a namespace mapping** that maps logical prefixes (`iwxxm`, `aixm`, `gml`, etc.) to the actual namespace URIs found in the document
5. **Use this mapping** when constructing XPath expressions for data extraction

**Python Implementation**: The [IBL swimdemo iwxxm_utils.py](https://github.com/iblsoft/swimdemo/blob/main/iwxxm_utils.py) provides a working example of this approach.

**Legacy vs. Current Namespace Examples**:

```xml
<!-- Legacy IWXXM (pre-2023) -->
xmlns:iwxxm="http://icao.int/iwxxm/2.1"
xmlns:aixm="http://www.aixm.aero/schema/5.1.1"
xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml/3.2"

<!-- Current IWXXM (2023+) -->
xmlns:iwxxm="https://schemas.wmo.int/iwxxm/2023-1"
xmlns:aixm="http://www.aixm.aero/schema/5.1.1"
xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml/3.2"
```

> **Note**: Always detect namespaces dynamically from the actual XML document rather than assuming specific versions. This ensures compatibility with both legacy and current IWXXM implementations.

#### Document Structure Overview

IWXXM documents have different root elements depending on the report type:

- **METAR/SPECI**: `<iwxxm:METAR>`
- **TAF**: `<iwxxm:TAF>`
- **SIGMET**: `<iwxxm:SIGMET>`

Each document contains:

1. **Report metadata** (issue time, status, location references)
2. **Validity period** (for TAF and SIGMET)
3. **Observation time** (for METAR/SPECI)
4. **Location information** (aerodrome or airspace references)
5. **Meteorological content** (actual weather observations/forecasts)
